# Basketball Substitution Tracker

This web-based application helps basketball coaches manage player substitutions during a game. It allows coaches to:
- Enter player names for each position (Point Guard, Center, Power Forward, Wing).
- Track the game time and receive notifications when it's time for substitutions (every 3:30).
- Substitute two players at a time, keeping the correct number of players in each position on the court.

## How to Use

1. Open the `index.html` file in your browser.
2. Enter the names of your players in the form fields.
3. Click "Start Game" to begin the game timer.
4. The timer will count down, and every 3:30, a substitution prompt will appear.
5. Click "Substitute Players" when it's time to switch players.
